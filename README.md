# CrimeBuster -- A web application that aids law enforcement to track crime data in various ways.


Crime Buster was designed to model a crime data visualization application that can assist the Baltimore 
police in making decisions regarding crime prevention. By using the crime dataset on the Open Baltimore website, 
Crime Buster allows its users to filter the dataset and generate various visualizations such as geospatial maps, heat maps, charts, 
and stacked bar graphs. These visualizations can be used to investigate and determine locations, time, patterns, 
and occurrence of certain crime, which will assist the police in creating better solutions that will help make Baltimore safer.
